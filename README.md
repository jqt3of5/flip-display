# Flip Display Christmas Present 2022

Every year with my wife's family we do "secret santa". One of the main rules of this secret santa is that the gift must 
be homemade. We like to try and do something challenging each year, and this year we're making a flip display clock. All 
of the acrylic was purchased from [Craft Closet](https://craftcloset.com)

## Overview


## Flap Design

One of the most important parts of the design is with the actual flaps. It also happens to be the most complicated part too.
First of all, the more representable characters you want, the larger the overall thing is going to be. So ideally you 
want to use a material that is as thin as possible. Typically, people will use specially cut PVC cards that are about 30 mil (.76 mm)
thick. However, one of the requirements for this project is that the materials were all laser cut. And PVC is not a laser save material. 
So we went with a 1/16th inch acrylic. This is about twice the thickness (60 mil) of the PVC flaps, so to keep the size of the overall display 
in check we opted to limit ourselves to 11 representable characters and build a clock.
