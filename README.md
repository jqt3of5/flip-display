# Flip Display Christmas Present 2022

Every year with my wife's family we do "secret santa". One of the main rules of this secret santa is that the gift must 
be homemade. We like to try and do something challenging each year, and this year we're making a flip display clock. All 
of the acrylic was purchased from [Craft Closet](https://craftcloset.com)
